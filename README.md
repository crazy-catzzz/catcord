WIP custom Discord Client written in Java.

## Why?
I don't like the constant Nitro ads on the official client and I wanted to try making one myself.

## The state of the project
It's in a very early state, there is no GUI, the wrapper around the Discord API isn't complete either, in other words, there's still a lot of work to do.
